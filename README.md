CP1404 Assignment 2 - Songs to Learn 2.0 by YOUR_NAME
A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of Songs to Learn.

Project Reflection
1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
The project take me 10 days in to finish include the coding and testing and fixing it.
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

2. What are you most satisfied with?
When I started my first work, I was most satisfied that, no matter how hard and tired I was, I was still able to operate some of the key functions
required for project guidance. In the beginning, I was completely caught up in how difficult it was to be a professional, so I didn'tentimes.
I compared it to the same material that I had learned in class, so I had to really work hard to study it, I had to understand it, 
and I was not very satisfied with the fact that I was able to produce it.

3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am not very satisfied with my understanding of the entire project before, during and after completion. It was very difficult for me and I was dissatisfied with my understanding of the materials needed for the project. The project itself covers what we've taught in class, but I think it's too high to take advantage of everything we've learned. So I'm not satisfied that the project went so well that I thought I could have done better if I knew how to better code not just the material, but the things that were needed for the project, and what was specific.

4. What worked well in your development process?
This project was very difficult for me, but I'm satisfied with how I've developed through all the trials/processes. I learned a lot of new things that I didn't know before I did the project, and some of them don't seem to have as much coverage or concentration as possible in class as I could apply to the project itself. Overall, I am satisfied with the new things that I can learn from this experience.

5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Next time, I'd like to make time for the instructor's questions as well as for the project.In order to participate in the project by returning to the main topic of the class, the project will be improved by modifying all topics or data as much as possible and asking questions when appropriate.

6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I used the lecture slide and do some research on youtube as my resource. And I used some python books which I brought from my country.
I enriched my assignment by adding references to what I learned in class. Also, I found the answer to my question through references if I don't know anything while doing the assignment.

7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
My biggest challenge in this project is that the knowledge and materials I was dealing with in class are much more advanced than they were in class, so I'm almost blind.But because of this project, I was able to confront this new challenge head-on and learn a lot of new things in the middle. Many of the parts in the project are extremely difficult to understand, and I managed to make what I thought was the lowest possible product for the project, but I can't say I've overcome the challenge, but it's certainly not that bad.

8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
The use of classes improves program efficiency by allowing code reuse. In addition, grouping and storing related functions in one place (inside the class) provided a clean structure to enhance the readability of the program, and compared to the previous assignment, we were able to work more neatly and efficiently.
